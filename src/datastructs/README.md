# Data Structures`

## Description

These are modules for general data structures like lists, hashes and
trees that are well tested and can be used to support more complex
game development.

### General data structures

  * vector: dynamic arrays
  * queues: macro-based queue
  * quad tree: spatial partitioning
  * treeset: for set management using a binary search tree (red-black)

### Spatial hashing

Data structures that are both efficient in terms of memory and speed.
Used internally by the engine

  * bit sets: for dirty rectangles
  * hash grids: for AABB collision detection
