RATR0 is a C game development framework for classic Amiga computers with at least
a Motorola 68000 CPU, OCS/ECS chipset and Amiga OS 1.2.

## Motivation

## Architecture & Design


The core of RATR0 was designed to be a thin abstraction on top of the Amiga
hardware. The purpose is to facilitate game development without taking away
too many resources for the sake of a more sophisticated object model.
